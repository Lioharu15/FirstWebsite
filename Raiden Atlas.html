      <b>Backstory:</b>
      <br />
      Raiden lives alone in a hidden woodland on the outskirts of society,
      minding his business. He has forest creatures who normally come to visit
      him that he regularly feeds. Although he has a younger brother, they do
      not comunicate much these days. Raiden practices with the supernatural-
      owning many crystals and other objects known to have lost spirits
      connected to them. He can hear their woes and tries to make offerings when
      he can in an attempt to help them move on peacefully.
