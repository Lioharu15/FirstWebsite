      <b>Backstory:</b>
      <br />
      Ethan grew up in what you would call a "broken home". His mother died when
      he was very young, leaving him and his elder sister alone with their
      abusive father. He had children very young- getting his first love
      pregnant when they were seniors in highschool. The year after, a close
      friend of theirs offered to be a surrogate for them and his second child
      was born. Unfortunately, shortly after that, Ethan's lover passed away. He
      was left with two children and being a single father at the ripe age of
      19.
