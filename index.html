    <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
    <p>
      This is an introduction page to two of my nearest and dearest
      <abbr title="Own Characters">OCs</abbr>. In my spare time, I love creating
      stories for these characters I draw and bringing them to life. The two
      featured on this website are two of my most loved OCs, Ethan and Raiden. I
      occasionally stream in my freetime, and Raiden is actually my PNGtuber
      that I drew myself. Ethan was the base for my VTuber I have as well,
      though that one I did not draw myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two pages will give you an introduction to these two OCs, letting
      you understand more of their character while also absorbing what they look
      like with attached images.
